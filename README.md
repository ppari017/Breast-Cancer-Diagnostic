# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic

The project focuses on diagnosing breast cancer using machine learning models to improve the accuracy of early detection and classification of tumors as either benign or malignant. Breast cancer is a major cause of death, and accurate diagnosis can help improve outcomes. The dataset used consists of features derived from digitized images of breast masses, including characteristics of cell nuclei.

The project explores multiple machine learning algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and an Ensemble Voting Classifier. It also includes a deep learning model, with a neural network architecture consisting of two hidden layers, used to enhance the classification performance.

After data preparation and exploratory analysis, the Support Vector Machine model achieved the highest accuracy at 98%, making it a highly reliable tool for classification tasks. The project concluded with the deployment of the models for real-world application, with deep learning achieving a test accuracy of 96.49%.
